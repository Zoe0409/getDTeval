# Introduction

Using the `get()` and `eval()` functions allows for more programmatic coding designs that enable greater flexibility and more dynamic computations. However, in data.table statements, `get()` and `eval()` reduce the efficiency of the method by performing work prior to data.table's optimized computations. **getDTeval** is useful in translateing `get()` and `eval()` statements more efficiently for improved runtime performance.

# Functions

**getDTeval** package has 2 main functions. The main purpose of developing the package is to translates `get()` and `eval()` statements more efficiently, which allows a user to both incorporate programmatic designs and while utilizing data.table's efficient processing routines.

 - **benchmark.getDTeval** performs a benchmarking experiment for data.table coding statements that use `get()` or `eval()` for programmatic designs.  The a) original statement is compared to b) passing the original statement through getDTeval and also to c) an optimized coding statement.  The results can demonstrate the overall improvement of using the coding translations offered by `getDTeval::getDTeval()`.

 - **getDTeval** offers a method of fully translating coding statements into an optimized coding statement.

# Applications and benefits

There are some major applications to the getDTeval package:

**1). Combining programmatic coding designs with data.table's efficiency. Better utilizing `get()` and `eval()` without the trade-offs in performance.**

This is a benchmarking experiment on the snack.dat from formulaic package. The result shows the reduction in running time using getDTeval over the original statement.
```{r benchmark.getDTeval_example}
the.statement <- "dat[get(age.name) > 65, .(mean_awareness = mean(get(awareness.name))), keyby = c(gender.name, region.name)]"

benchmark.getDTeval(the.statement = the.statement)
```

**2). Expanding on the use of `eval()` in data.table's calculations.** 

In data.table's cacluations, `eval()` within a `.()` calculation in the j step is not allowed. For example, if we try to run `dat[, .(eval(mean.age.name) = mean(get(age.name)))]`, then the error message would be `Error: unexpected '=' in "dat[, .(eval(mean.age.name) ="`

```{r getDTeval_example1_with_error, error = TRUE, purl = FALSE}
dat[, .(eval(mean.age.name) = mean(get(age.name)))]
```

However, using getDTeval allows this to work:

```{r getDTeval_example1}
getDTeval(the.statement = "dat[, .(eval(mean.age.name) = mean(get(age.name)))]")
```

**3). Expanding on the use of `eval()` in dplyr code.** 

`eval()` steps in dplyr code is not allowed. For example, if we try to run `dat %>% summarize(eval(mean.age.name) = mean(get(age.name)))`, then the error message would be `Error: unexpected '=' in "dat %>% summarize(eval(mean.age.name) ="`

```{r getDTeval_example2_with_error, error = TRUE, purl = FALSE}
dat %>% summarize(eval(mean.age.name) = mean(get(age.name)))
```

However, using getDTeval allows this to work:

```{r getDTeval_example2}
getDTeval(the.statement = "dat %>% summarize(eval(mean.age.name) = mean(get(age.name)))")
```
